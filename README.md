# Mod Loader for The Long Dark

Only being able to install one mod at a time sucks and having to ship the entirety of `Assembly-CSharp.dll` for a mod that changes a few lines of code isn't great, either.

**Enter TLD Mod Loader**

This mod loader allows users to easily install and run lots of mods at once!  
It also makes the modder's job easier by making method patching a breeze.  
Furthermore, the mod DLLs should only include the code that is being changed instead of the whole assembly.  
Thus, mods are generally only a few kilobytes in size and usually don't contain any copyrighted material.

*This project uses [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) for its method patching. Many thanks to the developers of this amazing tool!*

## Compatibility

This tool has been tested for **The Long Dark v0.426** on **Windows x64** and **Linux x64**.  
Mac OS and 32-bit operating systems have not been tested, but the tool should theoretically work there, too.  
If you are able to test the the installer and mod loader on any of these platforms, please report your findings - whether it be successful or not - to the [issues page](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller/issues). Thank you!
